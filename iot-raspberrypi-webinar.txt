I wanted to control an LED/Device from a remote area
  assuming that Device - Mumbai, and User - Hyderabad.

Here the user and Device are far-away, there not in a network. But, 
  they were connected through Internet.

WhatsApp - How whatsapp will work?
User1 - United States - Internet
User2 - Hyderabad (India) - Internet

Can they be communicated or not?
Device - Internet
User - Internet

Device (pub) -> User (sub)
User (pub) -> Device (sub) 

How do they get communicated?
MQTT - Message Queue Telemetry Transport

1. Publisher - pub - Sender - Sending Message
2. Subscriber - sub - Receiver - Receiving Message
3. Broker - Global Server (Cloud) - Connectivity
4. Topic - Identity of a end-module (user, device) - Group Name 

user (pub) - ledon - Broker - ledon - device (sub) 

Broker - open-source Brokers - broker.hivemq.com, 1883
Group Name - iot/webinar
